                The Indian Institute of Technology Patna has a glorious past of more than 15
                years and has been widely acclaimed for its excellence in education, research, and training. A special
                emphasis is laid on total personality development along with the quality education and technical
                training of the students. Indian Institute of Technology Patna is fully networked with industry, as well
                as
                with the academic/scientific community. It has active collaborations with leading universities and
                industries in India and abroad. Indian Institute of Technology Patna is the alma mater of highly
                distinguished world-class engineers and technologists.<br><br>
                Indian Institute of Technology Patna has kept the quality of education and research as its main focus of
                academic and professional activities, and this has earned a high reputation in the country and abroad
                as
                is evident from IITP figuring several times among the top ten engineering institutions in the country
                along with the IITs. Alumni, Staff, students, and supporters take pride in having contributed to the
                Indian Institute of Technology Patna reputation as India's flagship, research-led university, known for
                the
                excellence of its teaching, research, and service to its local, national and international communities.
                Our challenge for the future is to build on this strong base to establish ourselves firmly among the
                world's leading universities. I hope our outstanding students will support us in this endeavor and in
                turn emerge themselves, as pioneers of an exemplary society.
